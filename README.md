## 1. Introduction to Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching a web page's content and parsing the relevant information for various purposes. Scraping is commonly used in data analysis, market research, and automation.
Key Benefits of Web Scraping:
- Automated data collection
- Real-time data updates
- Cost-efficient compared to manual data entry

## 2. Web Crawling vs. Web Scraping
### Web Crawling
Web crawling refers to systematically browsing the internet to index web pages. Search engines like Google use crawlers (bots) to gather and index content.
Features of Crawling:
- Focused on discovering and indexing URLs
- Operates broadly across many sites
### Web Scraping
Web scraping focuses on extracting specific data from selected websites. Unlike crawling, it targets detailed information.
Comparison:
| Aspect              | Web Crawling              | Web Scraping          |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Purpose            | Indexing web pages       | Extracting data       |
| Scale              | Large (entire web)       | Targeted             |
| Tools              | Crawlers like Scrapy     | Parsers like BeautifulSoup |

## 3. Overview of TCP/IP
### What is TCP/IP?
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a foundational set of communication protocols for the internet. It enables data exchange between devices.
### Layers of TCP/IP:
1. **Application Layer**: Protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP.
2. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer using TCP or UDP.
3. **Internet Layer**: Handles routing with IP.
4. **Network Access Layer**: Manages physical data transmission.
---
## 4. Understanding HTTP
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the backbone of data communication on the web. It is used for fetching resources like HTML documents and APIs.
### Key Concepts:
- **Request/Response Model**: Client sends requests; the server responds.
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Status Codes**: Indicate the result of requests (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- **HTTP Headers**: Carry metadata (e.g., Content-Type).

## 5. Basics of HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures the content of web pages. It uses tags and attributes to define elements.
### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Web Scraping</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Web Scraping</h1>
    <p>Learn the basics of HTML here.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
### Common Tags:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings
- `<p>`: Paragraphs
- `<a>`: Links
- `<div>`: Containers
---
## 6. Introduction to CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
### Example:
```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  h1 {
    color: #333;
  }
</style>
```
### Key Features:
- **Selectors**: Target elements (`h1`, `.class`, `#id`).
- **Properties**: Define styles (`color`, `margin`, `font-size`).
- **Cascading Rules**: Determine which styles apply.
---
## 7. The DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents a page as a tree structure, enabling scripts to dynamically access and update content.
### Key Concepts:
- **Nodes**: Each element, attribute, or text is a node.
- **Tree Structure**: Parent-child relationships between elements.
- **APIs**: JavaScript allows DOM manipulation.
### Example:
HTML:
```html
<ul id="items">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
JavaScript:
```javascript
const list = document.getElementById('items');
list.children[0].textContent = 'Updated Item';
```
---
## 8. XPath for Web Scraping
XPath is a syntax for navigating and querying XML/HTML documents. It is commonly used in web scraping to locate elements precisely.
### Example:
HTML:
```html
<div>
  <p class="info">Sample Text</p>
</div>
```
XPath Query:
```xpath
//p[@class='info']
```
### Key Features:
- **Absolute Paths**: Start from the root (e.g., `/html/body/div`).
- **Relative Paths**: Focus on specific elements (e.g., `//p[@class='info']`).
- **Functions**: Extract attributes (e.g., `@href`).
---
## 9. Practical Applications and Use Cases
- **Market Analysis**: Scraping competitor prices.
- **Academic Research**: Collecting data for analysis.
- **News Aggregation**: Compiling articles.
- **E-commerce**: Monitoring stock and reviews.

## 10. Conclusion
Web scraping and its associated technologies like HTTP, HTML, CSS, DOM, and XPath empower developers to automate data collection. While web scraping offers immense potential, ethical considerations and legal compliance are crucial.
